    "3. **Repeat this process** as many times as desired, appending each result to the user's signature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of explicitly permuting the rows (which is computationally expensive), we use **hash functions** to simulate the permutation process. A hash function for an input integer $x$ is defined as:\n",

    "- $c$ is a **prime number** slightly larger than the number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach avoids true permutations and computes the hash values directly. While this may result in hash collisions (where two rows map to the same value), the effect can be minimized by choosing appropriate values for $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this framework, our algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the **signature matrix** with all values set to $\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each row, compute $h_1(r), h_2(r), \\dots, h_n(r)$ for $n$ random hash functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each column $c$ of row $r$:\n",
    "    - If $c$ has a $0$ in row $r$, skip it.\n",
    "    - If $c$ has a $1$ in row $r$, update $S(i, c)$ for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ to be the **minimum** of the current value of $S(i, c)$ and $h_i(r)$.\n",

    "Through this method, we produce vectors of equal length that contain positive integer values representing the MinHash signatures for each user, based on the movies they have rated. These signatures allow us to approximate user similarity efficiently. Ideally, we want to hash users into **buckets** such that users with similar preferences (based on their movie lists) end up in the same bucket. However, if we hash based on the entire signature as a whole, only identical signatures would end up in the same bucket, which is not practical for approximate similarity searches.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Key Aspects**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hash Functions ($n = 100$)**:\n",
    "   - The total number of hash functions used to generate the MinHash signatures is fixed at $n = 100$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Banding Parameter ($b$)**:\n",
    "   - The curves represent different values of $b$ (number of bands).\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     - $b = 5$: Larger number of rows per band ($r = n / b = 20$).\n",
    "     - $b = 50$: Smaller number of rows per band ($r = n / b = 2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trade-off Between $b$ and $r$**:\n",
    "   - **Fewer bands ($b$) and more rows per band ($r$)**:\n",
    "     - The curve is steeper, requiring higher similarity for users to be hashed to the same bucket.\n",
    "     - Reduces false positives but increases false negatives.\n",
    "   - **More bands ($b$) and fewer rows per band ($r$)**:\n",
    "     - The curve is smoother, allowing even lower similarity pairs to hash into the same bucket.\n",
    "     - Increases false positives but reduces false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpretation of Similarity $s$**:\n",
    "   - $s = 0$: Probability is $0$, meaning users with no similarity will not hash to the same bucket.\n",
    "   - $s = 1$: Probability is $1$, meaning users with identical signatures will always hash to the same bucket.\n",
    "   - Intermediate $s$ values (e.g., $s = 0.4, 0.6$): The probability increases as similarity grows, depending on $b$ and $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use Case**:\n",
    "   - This plot helps determine the optimal $b$ and $r$ configuration based on the desired trade-off between false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Probability Formula**:\n",
    "The probability of a pair of users being hashed into the same bucket is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{P} = 1 - (1 - s^r)^b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $b$: Number of bands.\n",
    "- $r$: Number of rows per band $\\left(r = \\frac{\\text{signature length}}{b}\\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Recommendation**\n",
    "- For applications that require **high precision** (fewer false positives), choose configurations with fewer bands ($b = 5$ or $b = 10$).\n",
    "- For applications that tolerate **false positives** but emphasize capturing similar users, choose configurations with more bands ($b = 25$ or $b = 50$).\n",
